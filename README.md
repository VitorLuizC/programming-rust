# Programming Rust

This repository keeps my notes, links, and code snippets about the Rust programming language. I'll try to organize it so that other developers can benefit from my studies.

I'll not lie. I've already seen some videos and content about Rust, mostly because I follow rust programmers on Twitter. Still, I didn't focus on learning the programming language before.

## Resources

I'm using the first edition of **Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development**.

## About me

You can see my position and experience on my LinkedIn, <https://linkedin.com/in/vitorluizc>. But in summary, I'm a pretty good TS/JS developer that wants to learn Rust to develop a 2D MMORPG.
