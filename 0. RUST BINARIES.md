# Rust Binaries

Since I don't like to install stuff globally on my computer I've written a [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) and [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) files to execute Rust's binaries from Docker.

So, instead of running, directly I'll run them using `docker-compose`.

```bash
docker-compose run cargo --version
docker-compose run rustc --version
docker-compose run rustdoc --version
```
